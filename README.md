# CircleFight
CircleFight is a 2D web game that is about being the last one standing in a fighting arena! ðŸ˜‚
You will be able to create an account and login. This web app will have all of those typical features such as
resetting password etc.

## Technologies

### Clint side
The client side of the application, which is what you see in the browser
is using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). 
Next.js will server side render the application to increase SEO performance
and in general increase performance as the browser doesn't have to run React code (Javascript code)
to render the initial content.

### Server side
The server side of the application a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), which is what the client side is communicating with
is using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is being used as a nice wrapper around MongoDB.



### Database
The database is going to be a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database, more specifcally [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### File server
Have no idea how and where I should set this up.ðŸ¤”

## The future
I will update this with some other technologies that I will use with this web app
such as: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/).

I will also update where and how I will deploy my web app to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

I stll have no idea where I should deploy my file server and database.ðŸ¤”

Maybe I will make this a public repository or at least give other people permission to contribute to this repository.
